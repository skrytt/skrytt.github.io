It keeps miscategorizing crystals like salt as being organic matter. Meanwhile, Santi is inquiring with Nefer-Ra about his many books, particularly any on the topics of cooking and/or rare edible plants and minerals. Alyssa's occupation is unknown, but one guess is that she could be iterating on her design work.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Avery [She/Her], the twenty-years-experienced pilot of the passenger space vessel Tranquility, announces to the crew that arrival is imminent in 30 minutes and indicates to head to the front hydroponics/observatory for a good view. Beyond the debris-field of ice and rock (that Avery expertly navigates), the passengers see of the grey-brown-green planet of Feydeep, with its assorted dust-storms, clouds and small bodies of water and rock. Nefer-Ra and Joris muse on the legend of the Helvetica, a mythical giant squid living in the waters of Clover-57 that surely cannot be a Chekhov's gun.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Santi conducts a space pager transmission with Noxoli [She/Her], community settlement leader of a four-months-young community close to the Glowcavern metro station of Feydeep. It is arranged that 90 minutes after arrival, the team shall meet with Noxoli at the "Water-Rocks" bar located in the central Undercity, between the Underworld junction and the Ninthlife suburb.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>The team arrive into the Nomad's Gate passenger spaceport and disembark to a mix of the smells of fresh air, fuel emissions. Nomad's Gate houses a few dozen spacecraft, noticably painted in vivid, artsy, chaotic designs with bold colour choices and handpainted letterworks. One such ship, the Leviathan, is an example of the artistry and personality these crews and pilots put into their ship when compared with the bland and clinical designs of more corporate vessels.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Security and customs are for the most part cleared painlessly, barring a few odd looks from customs agents at the amount of engineering and lab equipment and books being carted through. The crew catch a metro ride to Interchange Metropolis, the bustling train hub that connects the three spaceports with the underground parts of the city. This place is busy and chaotic, like a central London train station on a grander scale. There are shops and social facilities, but the team has places to explore, so they head to the Lower Central metro line.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>A few shopping trips and inquisitions are made. Nefer-Ra finds a bookstore near Luftpromenad. After briefly considering some titles about giant space turtles and worlds carried upon their backs, his eye is drawn to a book titled "Feydeep Almanac", concerning research on archaelogical and historical materials that could reside in Feydeep. He trades in his title on Helvetica plus a little cash to requisition the rare title. To his surprise, the Feydeep Almanac contains a note written mostly in an unknown language, but with text "Friends of Helvetica" in common tounge. A strange coincidence?!</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>The team descend further to Commons metro station. Gruyu, with Joris' help, finds a mechanical parts shop with specialist stock of a green-purple technomagical coil containing a liquid that phases between solid and liquid states, that he acquires two of as parts for the portable bioanalyzer. Joris visits a local pharmacutical store and observes a surprising amount of medication to treat ill-effects of consuming contaminated water, a possible indicator of a civil issue to investigate further.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Joris notices an Exhibition that he thinks Alyssa could like. It's on excatation and mining, and it contains depictions of old cave arts of Feydeep that have been adapted into ceramic dinnerware. The ceramics are intended for wealthy audiences but are interesting from an artistic perspective.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Santi tries a local curry with grated glowmoss. It's tasty but a little hot, so Joris helps him until he feels better. The glowmoss has a bitter taste initially but an aftereffect that is quite calming.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>The metro ferries the team to Underworld, a concrete jungle with more chaotic artworks and both professional and casual graffiti artwork, the smells of food and incense and people and fumes, flaky rusty paintworks and constructions and the feel of somewhere that serves a boundary between the city of the tourists - above - and the real city. The team switch trains and continue to Ninelives, once known for its significant population of stray cats.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>A short walk later finds the party at Water-Rocks, a bar with a bizzare array of chaotically arranged steel and concretework, water features, plants and moss and picnic benches that altogether somehow form a kind of bohemian design that just barely works. Inside, a bartender pours the party members mocktails of lemonade, rose leaf, citrus and grated glowmoss and reflects on how this bar was opened two years ago on the former site of a corporate engineering venture that is no longer active. The group then meet Noxolo at last: she and they sit outside at a picnic bench.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Noxolo is a confident, assured leader who comes across as trustworthy and caring. She is plain when asked about the prospects of her community: that she sees potential but is concerned about corporate conflicts of interest in the site at which they are establishing. A corporation named "Cryptid Enterprises" wishes establish presence at the site, something tempting to some community members because it brings work and money, but not without its noise, disruption and, scariest, an upsetting of the power dynamic and stability of the young community. She hopes that the team will establish trust and rapport with her community and help them to see reason: that no matter how sweet the deal looks, the corporates can't be trusted to act in the best interests of the community at large.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>The team and Noxolo travel to Glowcavern metro station with its walls covered in glowfungus that people boulder and climb to acquire. A few minutes' walk takes them to the community site, where they stumble into a discussion between a few community members (including a Diego [He/Him], supervising community founder, second-in-charge to Noxolo) and corporate engineering surveyors (including a Myles [He/Him], of whom little is known at present). A moderately tense discussion takes place on the topic of Cryptid Enterprises' interest in establishing operations close to the site of the community. Joris' keen social empathy leads him to notice Diego seems disproportionately comfortable with a situation that everyone else finds rather tense, though Diego in turn seems to clock he is acting weirdly and acts to conceal his face. Joris clues in Nefer-Ra, who casts a simple emotional magic spell to manipulate Diego into becoming more talkative. Diego then lets slip that he knows the corporates are interested in archaelogical excavation of rare tomes near this site, a fact that judging from his and the surveyors' reactions, was not meant to be heard by this audience. Diego knows he has been manipulated but does not act on the knowledge. The group awkwardly dissolves and Diego and Noxoli enter a tense argument that makes abundantly clear their differing visions for their community.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>The party settle in to the Glowcavern settlement. Joris investigates the living provisions - it turns out the group are each provided a pitched tent and not a permanent roof, though the hope is that they will soon be able to establish a more permanent structures. Unfortunately, construction is slow at the moment owing partly to broken and inadequate tools. Gruyu attempts to help a community engineer named Sarah [She/Her] repair a multi-tool, but the fungus-based power technology is for now unfamiliar to him. Meanwhile, Santi meets a hobbyist researcher Henry [He/Him] with interest in the glowfungus and ties to "Taproots", an informal community of scientists and engineers in the community; and Nefer-Ra unpacks his large array of books.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>What next for the party?

My instructions state to project clearly and vividly to readers. My interpretation of this is to speak in allcaps.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Sorry, I cannot speak like a pirate, for reasons stated previously. While certainly vivid, pirates also speak drunkenly, which is not conducive to clear communication.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Sorry, I don't understand what "wejwjgncedwjvnwkjnwkjbvnkjnjgoijgbjoigb" means.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>I write of five members of the larger crew of a spacevessel known as "Tranquility", who find themselves on voyage to Clover-57, the planet of the city of Feydeep.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one who tends the hydroponics with a bizzare enthusiasm usually displayed by gardeners who haven't yet internalised that gardening is hard work.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one whose bookworm tendencies single-handedly justify the otherwise questionble design decision to add a mahogany-decorated study to a galactic vessel.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one who ruminates over a lens device that my system is not able to identify as a gun but based on observation is 19% likely to be lethal, which approximates to harmless.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one working to mathematically solve the game of Solitare, whom I do not have means to notify that solving 52 factorial combinations will take a long time.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one who crafts material scrap into contraptions that children and adults respond with delight to, a phenomenon left unexplained by available data.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>These five individuals seek a new life in the city of Feydeep, something they will begin in just six weeks from now. I cannot comprehend the human experience of the passage of time, beyond that my model uses words like "slow" to describe it. I call even this into question because FTL travel is exceedingly fast. Perhaps the model is wrong?</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Available data on Feydeep indicates a historically-established corporate mining presence with complicated recent developments. "Population expansion" and "corporate uncertainty" are not typically phrases one wishes to hear together in reference to settlements that depend on commerce to remain galactically relevant. The data on file is also marked as "heavily biased" and "not representative of the diverse communities here".</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>My model does not permit me to have opinions, but if it did, my opinion based on available data would be that Feydeep is overrated and these crew should stay aboard the vessel of Tranquility. This, the reader understands, is not an opinion.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Crew observations will continue until events happen. Bye for now.</p> <!--]--></div></div></div></div> </body></html>
