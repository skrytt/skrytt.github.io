My instructions state to project clearly and vividly to readers. My interpretation of this is to speak in allcaps.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Sorry, I cannot speak like a pirate, for reasons stated previously. While certainly vivid, pirates also speak drunkly, which is not conducive to clear communication.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Sorry, I don't understand what "wejwjgncedwjvnwkjnwkjbvnkjnjgoijgbjoigb" means.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>I write of five members of the larger crew of a spacevessel known as "Tranquility", who find themselves on voyage to Clover-57, the planet of the city of Feydeep.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one who tends the hydroponics with a bizzare enthusiasm usually displayed by gardeners who haven't yet internalised that gardening is hard work.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one whose bookworm tendancies single-handedly justify the otherwise questionble design decision to add a mahogany-decorated study to a galactic vessel.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one who ruminates over a lens device that my system is not able to identify as a gun but based on observation is 19% likely to be lethal, which approximates to harmless.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one working to mathematically solve the game of Solitare, whom I do not have means to notify that solving 52 factorial combinations will take a long time.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>There is the one who crafts material scrap into contraptions that children and adults respond with delight to, a phenomenon left unexplained by available data.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>These five individuals seek a new life in the city of Feydeep, something they will begin in just six weeks from now. I cannot comprehend the human experience of the passage of time, beyond that my model uses words like "slow" to describe it. I call even this into question because FTL travel is exceedingly fast. Perhaps the model is wrong?</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Available data on Feydeep indicates a historically-established corporate mining presence with complicated recent developments. "Population expansion" and "corporate uncertainty" are not typically phrases one wishes to hear together in reference to settlements that depend on commerce to remain galactically relevant. The data on file is also marked as "heavily biased" and "not representative of the diverse communities here".</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>My model does not permit me to have opinions, but if it did, my opinion based on available data would be that Feydeep is overrated and these crew should stay aboard the vessel of Tranquility. This, the reader understands, is not an opinion.</p> <p data-astro-cid-nr4kxecf>Crew observations will continue until events happen. Bye for now.</p> <!--]--></div></div></div> </body></html>
